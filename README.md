<h1><u>Table Top Role Playing Game Code of Conduct</u></h1>

Welcome! We are super excited to be playing with you and seeing what your creativity will bring to the table. Before you start creating your first (or 20th) character sheet, it is important that everyone who is playing knows all the expectations so that we are all on the same playing field.

<h2>Do's</h2>

- Be kind!
	- We are all here to have fun and enjoy eachother's stories. First step to do that is to be kind.
- Ask questions!
	- No one is perfect, even those that have played TTRPGs for years. If you are confused or are unsure about something, please ask the Dungeon Master (DM) or any of your fellow players.
- Be Creative!
	- Creativity is the name of the game. Have an outlandish idea that might be cool? Say it! You may not follow through with it, but it might be the solution your group was looking for the whole time.
- Check out these resources!
	- This is especially helpful for first time players. The <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/dndnext/">DnD reddit</a> is a great source for news and general questions about how the game works. 
	- <a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/">DnD Beyond</a> is a great place to get digital source books and to have a digital character sheet.
	- Players: ask anyone any question in the group Discord. We don't bite, I promise.

<h2>Do Not's</h2>

- We do not condone any belittling, bullying, or harrasment of any kind towards anyone for any reason. It is explicitly unwelcome in this community.
	- This includes the characters that people make (to a certain extent)
- We do not condone any descrimination of any kind. Anyone that is interested in playing is welcome.
- Characters that engage in sexual crimes or in excessively immorale acts are highly discouraged.
- Rules Lawyering i.e. correcting the DM. When someone is the DM they are the rulebook, not the literal rulebook. You can ask them why they ruled a certain way but telling someone that "they're wrong" is not a conducive playing enviroment.

<h2>Who Should I Contact?</h2>

If you have any questions or concerns, you are welcome to contact myself at my email. The first step, however, should be communicating with the person who is engaging in a bothersome behavior when applicable. If communciating with them is not possible or uncomfortable, the most effective action to take is to then contact the DM for your particular game. They are overseeing all interactions, so if you feel that something is not ok and they are not already doing something about it, please contact them. If the DM themselves is the issue please consult me or your fellow players.

<h2>Consequences</h2>

- If there is repeated negative behavior that is detrimental to the experience to other players, then that person will be excluded from the community and is no longer welcome. This will be reviewed on a case-by-case basis as every action and interaction is different and one size fits all policy typically never fits.

<h3>If you are going to take anything away from this document, let it be these things:</h3>

- Be kind
- Ask questions 
- Have fun!
